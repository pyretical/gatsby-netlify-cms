### The Artist

Above all I'm a painter. Despite a tendency to work with other mediums and tools, painting is where my creativity and skill is allowed to flow to it's fullest. Oil is my primary medium, though I do struggle through acrylic paintings from time to time just to prove I can. I also like ink and coffee and combine them into pieces that I'm not sure whether to call drawings or paintings. Inspiration is everywhere, from incredible experiences in nature to the way the light hits a concrete wall. I love light and color and grit and the mundane.


I hope to create work that resonates with people in some way but I'm not really sure how to do that yet. All I know is that there's beauty in this world and I hope to capture as much of it as I can.
